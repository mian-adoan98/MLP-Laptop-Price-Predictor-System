# Laptop Price Predictor

## Problem Statement

In E-Commerce websites where all different kind of laptops and notebooks are being displayed, there has been numourous of visited logs by users who are looking for the best buying price for a laptop. 
Most of the laptop prices are ranging from $800 up to $1500. However, some of expensive laptops do not have great specifications that satify the user's purchase expectations. Moreover, some misinformation about 
specifications make it harder for user which laptop are suitable and the best choice. This is exactly why machine learning is useful in this sceniaro, which is to make the best predictions on the laptop prices that 
are realistic and more preferable for buyers and additionally it helps to find the best specifications that could provide a better impact on the prices. 


## Objective
- Making predictions on laptop sale price based on properties of a given laptop.
- Building application on web environment where number of input features generate the predicted outcome
- Building an interactive application where user can specify his or her preferences for a price based on his expected laptop specification

## Project Workflow: Machine Learning Pipeline

In order to successfully accomplish in making the best laptop price predictor system for this use case, there has to be consequtive steps that need to be undertaken in several phases. 
These phases are mainly the foundation that a machine learning projects is comprised of and it also respects the principles Agile methodology whereby each phases are mutuable. The first focus of this project is to 
build a sophisticated machine learning system that perfectly performs in predicting the price of a laptop based on the specifications (considered as input feautres) that will be determined by the user. 

Phases that follows the machine learning Pipeline: 

  **1. Data Ingestion**
  **2. Data Preparation**
  **3. Exploratory Data Analysis**
  **4. Feature Engineering**
  **5. Model Development (Building & Training)**
  **6. Model Validation (Evaluation & Tuning)**
  **7. Model Deployment**
  **8. Model Monitoring & Optimization**
  **9. Frontend Development**
