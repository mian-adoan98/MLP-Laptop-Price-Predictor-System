# Laptop Price Predictor System 

## Laptop Price Prediction: Introduction 

Laptop Price prediction is a machine learning application that uses regression algorithm to make predictions on future laptop prices based on its properties. 
It is well-demanded in E-commerce and telecommunication bussinesses that provides users the ability to personalise their choice on different laptops sold globally. 
The laptops varies from notebook to high-performance laptops, like hp, asus, macbook, etc. 

## Problem Scope 

This project focuses on building an machine learning application on web environment where users can estimate the predicted price based on a couple of features. For instance 
user 1 consider to buy a laptop with brand HP with 16 GB Ram, 1 TB SSD Drive. These properties of the laptop will determine the estimated price attractive for the user to purchase.
The objectives of this project are: 

- Helping customer's choosing the best laptop price based on its specifications
- Predicting the sales in months based on past sold laptops
- Providing real-time insights for price comparison of laptops and benchmarking across different brands

## Machine Learning Pipeline

The pipeline for this machine learning projects involves different phases where the model is being trained on past laptop prices and its properties 
and increase its performance and making better predicted price for future laptops in the upcoming years. This involves:

- **Data Collection**
- **Data Preprocessing**:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training
- Model Validation and Tuning
- Model Deployment
- Model Monitoring**

At the last two phases where the principles of MLOps will come in heandy due to high scalibility and efficiency of developing the predictor system effectively using a variety of models with its highest performance. 
This will be discussed in future advancements.
